# EchoHola
EchoHola is a project designed to recognize people and greet them personally by name. The main goal is to create a natural and friendly interaction between humans and systems by combining person recognition with voice feedback.  The system identifies an individual using recognition technologies (such as facial recognition or voice recognition).
