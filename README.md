# EchoHola

EchoHola is a project designed to recognize people and greet them personally by name. The main goal is to create a natural and friendly interaction between humans and systems by combining person recognition with voice feedback.

The system identifies an individual using recognition technologies (such as facial recognition, voice recognition, or other identification methods) and automatically generates a personalized greeting like “Hello, Salvador.” This approach enhances user experience and makes interactions feel more human and engaging.

EchoHola can be applied in different environments, including offices, schools, smart homes, or access-controlled areas, where welcoming users in a personalized way adds value. The project is modular and extensible, allowing different recognition methods and voice engines to be integrated easily.

Overall, EchoHola aims to demonstrate how recognition technologies and speech synthesis can work together to create simple, friendly, and intelligent greeting systems.
